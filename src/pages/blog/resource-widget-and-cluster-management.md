This week's update is about resource management.

Learn about the new CPU/Memory widgets and how you can configure them appropriately to keep cluster resources in check.

## Resource widget

Developers want to be good citizens. If they have all the knowledge required to set requests and limits correctly, they do it.

Trainings, wikis, enforcement, feedback loops all suffer from a key problem however. They are not helping when developers have the most attention on the problem. When they are setting requests and limits.

Often they are on a mission to deploy their application, and the configuration details are just obstacles to reach that goal.
Setting just _some value_ is often their approach to get through this hurdle.

In Gimlet, we build the knowledge right in the tooling. Developers have the hints right where they need it, when they focus on the problem.

## Customizing the resource boundaries

All application configuration options are coming from the Master Template.

For the resource widget, we introduced a new variable type in the `questions.yaml` file.

Please meet the `int` variables with `range`:

```yaml
questions:
  - variable: replicas
    label: Replicas
    description: The number of instances to run
    type: int
    group: misc
    required: true
    default: 1
    range:
      min: 1
      max: 12
      step: 1
```

![Int ranges](/replicas.png)

They accept two new validation strategies as well: `minRatio` and `maxRatio`:

```diff
questions:
  - variable: requests
    label: Resource Requests
    description: "Requests are used by the cluster scheduler to place your workload on the best suiting server node."
    type: complex
    required: false
    group: resources
    patch: resourceRequests.yaml
    subquestions:
      - variable: cpu
        label: CPU
        description: "Indicates the average CPU usage of the application. 1000 CPU shares = 1 CPU core"
        type: int
        default: 500
        range:
          min: 100
          max: 8000
          step: 100
        unit: "m"
        readableUnit: "shares"
+       validation:
+         - type: minRatio
+           variable: limits.cpu
+           value: 0.1
+           description: "CPU limits should be a maximum of 10X of CPU requests. We are over-provisioning our cluster on purpose, but anything over 10X could hurt uptime. Please adjust your request or limit."
```

Learn more about the Master Template in the [documentation](https://docs.gimlet.io/setup/master-template/#int-variables-with-a-range-of-values).

## Over-committing cluster resources using min and `maxRatio`

As a cluster administrator you want to be in control of cluster resources. Over-comitting can save money, but extensive over-committing can cause issues down the line.

With `minRatio` and `maxRatio` you can keep over-committing in a desired range.

Edit the Master Template to reflect your policies.

## Conservative CPU over-commit

This example follows a more moderate over-commit approach. Allows to burst each resource to use 5X of its budgeted CPU.

```diff
questions:
  - variable: requests
    label: Resource Requests
    description: "Requests are used by the cluster scheduler to place your workload on the best suiting server node."
    type: complex
    required: false
    group: resources
    patch: resourceRequests.yaml
    subquestions:
      - variable: cpu
        label: CPU
        description: "Indicates the average CPU usage of the application. 1000 CPU shares = 1 CPU core"
        type: int
        default: 500
        range:
          min: 100
          max: 8000
          step: 100
        unit: "m"
        readableUnit: "shares"
        validation:
          - type: minRatio
            variable: limits.cpu
-           value: 0.1
+           value: 0.2
            description: "CPU limits should be a maximum of 10X of CPU requests. We are over-provisioning our cluster on purpose, but anything over 10X could hurt uptime. Please adjust your request or limit."
```

## Strict memory management

This example does not allow any memory over-commit.

While CPU over-commit only slows things down should all workload burst at the same time.
Memory over-commit starts evicting pods, which may cause downtime of workloads.

```yaml
questions:
  - variable: requests
    label: Resource Requests
    description: 'Requests are used by the cluster scheduler to place your workload on the best suiting server node.'
    type: complex
    required: false
    group: resources
    patch: resourceRequests.yaml
    subquestions:
      - variable: cpu
        label: CPU
        description: 'Indicates the average CPU usage of the application. 1000 CPU shares = 1 CPU core'
        type: int
        default: 500
        range:
          min: 100
          max: 8000
          step: 100
        unit: 'm'
        readableUnit: 'shares'
        validation:
          - type: minRatio
            value: '1'
            variable: limits.memory
            description: "Memory requests must be equal to memory limits. We don't allow memory over-commit in our cluster to prevent out of memory errors. Please adjust your request or limit."
          - type: maxRatio
            value: '1'
            variable: limits.memory
            description: 'Memory requests can not be higher than memory limits. Please adjust your request or limit.'
```
