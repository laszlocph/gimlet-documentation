I [did a live stream](https://www.youtube.com/live/u5l-F8nPumE) recently, trying out Vito Botta's `hetzner-k3s` tool ([vitobotta/hetzner-k3s](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s)) where I wanted to provision a single node Kubernetes cluster on Hetzner.

My first impressions were promising: Vito's tool was polished and Hetzner was much faster than most clouds I used. The tool created a 2 core/4GB/6.37EUR a month node and installed the cluster in a minute, and the tear down was not more than 15 seconds. I could rapidly iterate with my config and stay in the flow.

This blog post is a follow up to the stream, sharing my config for

- starting up a single node cluster,
- installing Nginx as an ingress controller,
- and exposing it on port 80 and 443 to the world.

## Why kubernetes on a VPS you may ask

Kubernetes is creeping into our lives by becoming the deployment standard at companies. While mongering complexity is a common side effect of adopting the platform, it does not have to be like that. Most Kubernetes commands are not more complex or risky than copying a sudo command from the Digital Ocean blog to a VPS

The resource overhead of the presented setup is also surprisingly low. Only five pods running in the cluster utilizing 10% of the CPU and 3 percent of the RAM.

```
$ kubectl describe node stream-cx21-master1

## Prerequisites

### Install `hetzner-k3s`

Follow the instructions on [https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s#installation](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s#installation)

### Get a Hetzner API key

You need to create a project on the Hetzner cloud console, and then an API token with both read and write permissions (sidebar > Security > API Tokens); you will see the token only once, so be sure to take note of it.

Make the token available in your terminal now for later use:

```
export HCLOUD_TOKEN=g0cY....
```

### Install `kubectl` and `helm`

- [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
- [https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#from-script)

## Cluster configuration

[vitobotta/hetzner-k3s](https://github.com/vitobotta/hetzner-k3s) is a single binary that creates everything that is needed for a kubernetes cluster on Hetzner. Think networks, load balancers, firewalls and VMs.

It takes a yaml configuration file parameter. Use this yaml for creating the cluster:

```yaml
---
cluster_name: tutorial
kubeconfig_path: "./kubeconfig"
k3s_version: v1.26.4+k3s1
public_ssh_key_path: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub" ## <-- replace with your SSH public key path
private_ssh_key_path: "~/.ssh/id_ed25519" ## <-- replace with your SSH private key path
use_ssh_agent: true
ssh_allowed_networks:
  - 78.92.157.253/32 ## <-- replace with your IP
api_allowed_networks:
  - 78.92.157.253/32 ## <-- replace with your IP
private_network_subnet: 10.1.0.0/16
schedule_workloads_on_masters: true
masters_pool:
  instance_type: cx21
  instance_count: 1
  location: hel1
worker_node_pools:
additional_packages:
- haproxy
post_create_commands: ## Downloads an HAProxy configuration file for port 80/443
- curl -o /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg https://gist.githubusercontent.com/laszlocph/61642778fb61e3d7c1766d31e676c0f7/raw/bf836c73ce24b07b2423251316e6f030ada6b3c9/haproxy.cfg
- service haproxy reload
```

Create the cluster now with:

```
hetzner-k3s create --config tutorial.yaml
```

```

```

Verify the cluster with:

```
$ export KUBECONFIG=kubeconfig

$ kubectl get nodes

NAME                  STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
stream-cx21-master1   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   3m13s   v1.26.4+k3s1
```

## Install Nginx

```
helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx

helm install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx \
  --set controller.service.type=NodePort \
  --set controller.service.nodePorts.http=32080 \
  --set controller.service.nodePorts.https=32443
```

Validate the installation:

```
$ kubectl get pods,svc

NAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/ingress-nginx-controller-5ff6bb675f-mrcrn   1/1     Running   0          35s

NAME                                         TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
service/ingress-nginx-controller             NodePort    10.43.93.39    <none>        80:32080/TCP,443:32443/TCP   35s
service/ingress-nginx-controller-admission   ClusterIP   10.43.75.218   <none>        443/TCP                      35s
service/kubernetes                           ClusterIP   10.43.0.1      <none>        443/TCP                      21m
```

## Open port 80 and 443 on the Hetzner firewall

sidebar > Firewalls > tutorial > Add rule

![Hetzner Firewall rule add](/add-rule.png)

Then validate if you see the Nginx 404 page:

```
$ curl http://37.27.3.154/

<html>
<head><title>404 Not Found</title></head>
<body>
<center><h1>404 Not Found</h1></center>
<hr><center>nginx</center>
</body>
</html>
```

Optionally you can set a DNS entry that points to your server's IP address.

## Deploy a static website

To test the ingress controller we are going to use the nip.io dynamic DNS service, and the [onechart/static-site](/blog/hosting-static-sites-on-kubernetes?ref=blog-a-6-37-mo-single-node-kubernetes-cluster-on-hetzner-with-vitobotta-hetzner-k3s) helm chart. This helm chart pulls the source code from git, builds it, then serves the files of a static website.

```
helm repo add onechart https://chart.onechart.dev

```

```
helm install my-react-app onechart/static-site \
  --set gitCloneUrl=https://github.com/gimlet-io/reactjs-test-app.git \
  --set buildImage=node:16.20-buster \
  --set buildScript="npm install && npm run build" \
  --set builtAssets=build/ \
  \
  --set ingress.host=my-react-app.37.27.3.154.nip.io \
  --set ingress.annotations.'kubernetes\.io/ingress\.class'=nginx
```

Validate the deployment:

```
$ kubectl get pods,ing 
NAME                                            READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
pod/ingress-nginx-controller-5ff6bb675f-mrcrn   1/1     Running    0          32m
pod/my-react-app-57966d7dfd-5vltr               0/1     Init:0/1   0          11s

NAME                                     CLASS    HOSTS                             ADDRESS   PORTS   AGE
ingress.networking.k8s.io/my-react-app   <none>   my-react-app.37.27.3.154.nip.io             80      11s
```

(you can track the build progress with: `kubectl logs -f deploy/my-react-app -c init-con`)

And access the application:

```
curl http://my-react-app.37.27.3.154.nip.io/
```

## Cleanup

You can clean up your experiment with:

```
hetzner-k3s delete --config tutorial.yaml
```

Onwards!
