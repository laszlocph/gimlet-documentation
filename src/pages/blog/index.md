Even the idea of comparison is wild, right?

But we gave it a serious thought. Hear us out.

We are going to keep scores! 🏀

We don't want to make you think.

There is always a catch with SaaS pricing, but we want to avoid it as much as possible.

{% post name="Running Kubernetes on your laptop with K3d" image="rocket.png" link="/blog/running-kubernetes-on-your-laptop-with-k3d" date="2023-07-12" %}
Kubernetes has emerged as the go-to platform. But setting up a cluster on a laptop feels like a complex task for many developers.

For this reason, we put together this blog post to show that with only a handful of commands you can go very far.

The way you structure your repository can greatly impact the efficiency and reliability of your gitops workflow.

In this article, we'll explore different approaches to structuring your gitops repository so you gain a better understanding of how to optimize your deployment process.

{% post name="Git: the ironclad system" image="git-ironclad.png" link="/blog/git-the-ironclad-system" date="2023-04-06" %}
Git is the most feared tool amongst the tools we use everyday. Over the years I developed an ironclad approach to git, to not get into trouble, and if I did, how to get out of it.

{% post name="Don't group environment variables" image="dont-group.png" link="/blog/dont-group-environment-variables" date="2023-04-03" %}
This is a preiodic reminder for application developers to not group environment variables. `APP_ENV=staging` easily becomes a blocker when you do application operation.

{% post name="Options for Kubernetes pod autoscaling" image="autoscaling.png" link="/blog/options-for-kubernetes-pod-autoscaling" date="2023-01-23" %}
The Gimlet.io team put together this blog to show common usecases of autoscaling:

- based on CPU
- custom Prometheus metrics
- and RabbitMQ queue length.

Furthermore, we are aiming to clear up the differences between the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA), the Prometheus Adapter and KEDA.

{% post name="Three problems with GitOps as deployment history, and how we overcome them" image="three-problems-with-gitops.png" link="/blog/three-problems-with-gitops-as-deployment-history-and-how-we-overcome-them" date="2022-11-01" %}
One often mentioned property of gitops is that it gives you a deployment history by nature. As you keep updating your desired deployment state in git, it builds up to a trail of changes that you can use to tell what version was deployed at a given time.

Our finding is that this git history is too sparse and noisy at the same time to be used for anything practical without tooling.

In this blog post we describe three problems we experienced once we adopted gitops and Flux CD, and what measures we implemented in Gimlet to overcome them. You may face similar issues in your own gitops platform implementation and this blog post can give you ideas about how to solve them.
{% /post %}

{% post name="How Flux broke the CI/CD feedback loop, and how we pieced it back together" image="gitops-broke-cicd.jpg" link="/blog/how-flux-broke-the-cicd-feedback-loop-and-how-we-pieced-it-back-together" date="2022-10-20" %}
A green build used to mean a successful deploy. But then gitops came and broke this heuristic.

The Kyverno policy engine just arrived in Gimlet Stack. Let's see how you can be certain that none of the containers run as root in your Kubernetes cluster.

{% post name="Gimlet Dashboard strategy" image="old-gimlet-ui.png" link="/blog/gimlet-dashboard-strategy" date="2021-05-03" %}
Gimlet Dashboard - or Gimlet Dash in short - is going to be Gimlet's UI component. It tackles multiple purposes, and this document is here to elaborate on that.

{% post name="The last-mile problem with Kubernetes" image="randy-laybourne-06P0tprVDvY-unsplash.jpg" link="/blog/the-last-mile-problem-with-kubernetes" date="2020-06-23" %}

> Transporting goods via freight rail networks and container ships is often the most efficient and cost-effective manner of shipping.
>
> However, when goods arrive at a high-capacity freight station or port, they must then be transported to their final destination. This last leg of the supply chain is often less efficient, comprising up to 41% of the total cost to move goods.

Something similar we see with Kubernetes projects.
