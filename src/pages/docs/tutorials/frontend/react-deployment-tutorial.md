React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications efficiently.

## Step 1: Getting Started with Gimlet

Log in to Gimlet by connecting your GitHub or GitLab account. You should see your repositories listed, but if you can't find the repo where your React app is located, you can use the search bar to find it.

Click the Import button to add the repository to Gimlet, then click the I am done importing button to save added repositories.

## Step 2: Deploy React

Click on the repository's card to select the repo. Click the New deployment button.

To deploy a React frontend, just select Static Site template. Check if any of the settings are needed to be changed.

You can use a custom domain, but Gimlet will generate one for you, which you can use to share your app after deployment.

If everything looks alright, click the Deploy button. Gimlet will build the application and run it as an Nginx container.

## Step 3: Check Out Your React App

After a successful deployment, a clickable link should appear next to deployment status. Click it to open it in your browser.

## Use Cases

Here are a few examples of why you should host your React frontend with Gimlet:

- **Social Login:** Share your React application with social login and HTTPS certification added.
- **Branch previews:** Test and share changes in your frontend with preview deployments.
- **Advanced deployment capabilities:** Roll back and automated deployments of new changes.
