# Get Started With CLI

Gimlet's CLI covers some, not all of the capabilities of the GUI.

## Installation

Here's how you can install it on Linux and Mac:

```
curl -L "https://github.com/gimlet-io/gimlet/releases/download/cli-v0.27.0/gimlet-$(uname)-$(uname -m)" -o gimlet
chmod +x gimlet
sudo mv ./gimlet /usr/local/bin/gimlet
gimlet --version
```

- Does the CLI have user auth of some type?
