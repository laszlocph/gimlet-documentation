## Welcome to the Gimlet universe!

Gimlet will get you a developer platform on top of Kubernetes.

It is built on the de-facto tools of the ecosystem - Helm and Flux - and provides you with a paved path, a set of best-practices, so you can focus on your task at hand. Without having to navigate the vast options the cloud native ecosystem offers you.
