  There are many ways to configure deployment settings with Gimlet. You can easily add HTTPS and social authentication to your application.

## Build with Gimlet

While it's not necessary, you can build images using Gimlet. The tool integrates [Buildpacks](), an open-source image builder tool.
## Social Authentication

Add social authentication to your application with a few clicks.

## Port-Forwarding

Make your app accessible on the internet with port-forwarding. You can do it with Gimlet, no SSH needed.

## DNS

Configure DNS settings with Nginx to make your service accessible from custom domains.

## HTTPS

Add HTTPS certification to your application with Let's Encrypt to secure connection between the app and your users.

## Deployment Configuration

Define deep-level configuration settings with Gimlet's UI instead of tinkering YAML files.

## Secrets

Manage and seal secrets for referenced use in your code base with the help of Bitnami's Sealed Secrets.

## Infrastructure Management

Connect and delete environments to Gimlet. Specify environment variables for custom configuration.
