**If you need port forwarding for your application, you can easily get a command for it after it's deployed. Not available in ephemeral environments during trial period.**

When you deploy and save the configuration by clicking the **Write configuration to Git** button, you'll be directed to the status screen of your deployment.

Click the (...) or meatballs menu in the top right corner of the status, and select **Copy port-forward command**.

The copied command can be run in the terminal of the environment where your application was deployed.
