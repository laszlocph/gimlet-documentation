# Deployments
There are several deployment capabilities suitable for every day use of Gimlet. Here's a high-level description of each capability and use case.
## Preview Deployments

Preview deployments, branch previews â€“ however you call it, you can easily deploy and share previews of your app for testing and demo purposes.
## Rollbacks

Roll back deployments to reinstate your application to a previous configuration / version when something goes wrong with a new release.
## Automated Deployments

Automate deployments when deploying new changes are repetitive and stand in the way of focused work during debugging and development.
