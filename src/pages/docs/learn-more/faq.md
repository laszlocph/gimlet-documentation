# Frequently Asked Questions

## Is there an API?
There's an API that serves the CLI, no extended functionality provided by the API as of the release of Gimlet One.
## Is Docker supported?
Unfortunately, no. You can only deploy to Kubernetes clusters with Gimlet.
## Is Gimlet ARM supported?
You can host Gimlet on both ARM and AMD architecture.
## What container registries are supported?

## I self-hosted Gimlet before the license change. How can I use it now?
We switched to Business Use License (BUSL) when we released Gimlet One, a.k.a. 1.0.0. This allows unlimited, free usage under $1 million US dollars of revenue. More details about our licensing and pricing are available [here]().
## Do I need to build images on my own?
No, Gimlet can do that for you before you deploy your app. But previously built images are also supported.
