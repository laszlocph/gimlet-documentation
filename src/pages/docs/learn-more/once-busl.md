# ONCE/BUSL

## Why ONCE?

The ONCE pricing model was the middle-ground between turning our software fully commercial and switching from open-source.

If you're not familiar with this, ONCE was introduced by Basecamp creator DHH when Campfire was launched. Their offering was to pay once for the major version of a software, and users will get all the updates and patches without added fees.

We considered our options, and decided that $300 is the most optimal price tag for our tool. For organizations, it's a budget-friendly price tag compared to the value it offers. Organizations burn substantially more money on the daily developing their in-house solutions, while Gimlet is designed to provide off-the-shelf hosting experience.

The thought-process behind the price tag is that organizations will need separate Gimlet instances to work efficiently, as roles and responsibilities across teams won't overlap between separate instances. Also, there are technical limitations that'll prevent multiple teams from using the same Gimlet instance.

For us, it's money, which we can use to deliver new features, host Gimlet for you and provide support when needed.
## How does ONCE work?

We tailored ONCE to have one-time annual payments across different major versions after the 7-day free trial expires.

Until the end of the 7th day we won't charge you. It's supposed to be enough time for you to decide whether you'd like to adopt Gimlet. Your license will expire a year from your purchase. In the meantime, you'll receive every upgrade, even major versions, too, if we release any of those.

On the technical level, you'll start off with an ephemeral infrastructure provided by us for the trial period and can't connect any real clusters until you're charged. In case you decide to purchase Gimlet, your instance will be moved to a permanent infrastructure. If not, all of your data, including git repository connections, deployed applications, and so on, will be removed and won't be recoverable.
## Why BUSL?

Gimlet started as closed-source, then we tested the waters of open-source. While we received some attention from contributors and users, unfortunately, we didn't find the audience to leave significant impact in the IDP scene - whether you use IDP to refer to Internal Developer Platforms or Internal Developer Portals, however, we consider Gimlet closer to platforms on this axis.

Even though we offer a monetized SaaS-version, we decided to leave the door open for users - organizational or individual - to self-host Gimlet if they'd like to. This comes without usage or feature limitations.

Self-hosted Gimlet will be free to use until 1 million US dollars of revenue. Otherwise the $300 annual pricing kicks in, as it's described in the [**Why ONCE?**]() section above.
