In software, things go wrong sometimes. It is inevitable, so best if you can roll back routinely. That's why Gimlet provides rollback tooling out of the box.

On this page, you will learn how to use it, first with the CLI, then on the UI, and learn what it actually does.

## On the command line

### Getting a quick overview

To roll back, first you have to get a good picture of what was released and when.

List the recent releases with Gimlet CLI:

```
gimlet release list --env staging --app my-app
```

```

```

### Roll back

Once you identified the broken release, roll back to the preceding one.
Gimlet will revert all gitops commits made after the desired release.

```
gimlet release rollback --env staging --app my-app --to c8d8c1d192
```

And verify the release state:

```
gimlet release list --env staging --app my-app
```

```

## On the dashboard

Each application has a release history bar with the ten most recent deploys.
If you click the bar, you will see the individual released versions, and you can click the "Rollback to this version" button next to it.

## What does rollback do

Rollbacks in Gimlet are preforming revert commits on all gitops commits that were made later than the release that you are rolling back to.

With this approach, you can be sure that a previous release will be applied verbatim on the cluster. No template rerenders, no waiting on the machinery.

{% callout title="Roll back or roll forward?" %}
You can't roll back an already rolled back commit. Best to roll forward in this case.

Rolling back is a quick, mindless way to jump back to a previously active gitops state. If you want to be more creative, best to roll forward by releasing a new version.
