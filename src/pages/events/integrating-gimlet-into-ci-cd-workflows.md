```
Date: Wednesday, 26th October, 2022
Time: 12:00 PM Central European Time
Hosts: Laszlo Fogas and TBD
```

On this second Gimlet online meetup you will learn how you can fit Gimlet into your CI/CD workflow. You can watch silently, or ask questions, it is up to you!

You will learn about:

- How GitOps broke the CI/CD feedback loop
- How can you get back to the "green build means successful deploy" heuristic
- How Gimlet works with GitHub Actions

This event will be a meetup, which means we are looking forward to hearing your questions, answering them as best we can and speaking technically about Gimlet.

We're scheduled for 60 minutes, but we will be sticking around until all questions have been answered.
