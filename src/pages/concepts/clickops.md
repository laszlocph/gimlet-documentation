Gimlet believes in the power of GUIs: they make complex technologies accessible for people. But GUIs often are associated with one-off changes and configuration drift.

We believe in the ClickOps philosophy, where clicking on a UI should not constitute for subpar engineering. Instead,

- we back every click with a git commit. The same commit that you would make by hand, or with our CLI
- if you decide to extend the gitops repository with custom changes, Gimlet pledges that it won't break the visual workflows

If not you, your team mates will appreciate it. Team mates, who don't have time to immerse fully in gitops and Kubernetes.

If you prefer, you can stick to the Gimlet CLI, which has the same power as the Gimlet Dashboard.
