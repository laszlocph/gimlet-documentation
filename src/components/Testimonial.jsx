I found that having all service deployments in the same place gives a better overview and also more control of the services. The UI is easy to use and you can easily change the configuration.

Even without a lot of prior Kubernetes knowledge, I could quickly get started developing and deploying services, while learning about the underlying bits and pieces in smaller steps, as they became relevant. The Web UI is really useful for getting a quick overview of the deployment state of a service. It is also very convenient in the rare case where you need to roll something back, and you don\'t have time to fiddle with command line tools.',
